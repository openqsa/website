                <p>Quadratic Sinusoidal Analysis, or QSA, is a mathematical theory developped by Christophe Magnani and
                        Lee E. Moore to elucidate the fundamental linear and nonlinear properties of excitable
                        membranes in the frequency domain, not only as a contrast and adjunct to real time methods, but
                        also a quantitative and unique approach to measure neuronal properties.</p>
                <p>Frequency domain methods can be used to quantitatively compare real neurons with their models. This
                        approach shows that the nonlinear behavior can also be accurately measured with frequency
                        domain methods, which can provide distinct advantages over real time methods.</p>
                <p>Linear analysis with random broad band stimuli is also time consuming, however significant reduction
                        of experimental time is possible if the same pseudo random stimulus containing a limited number
                        of frequencies is applied to the preparation.</p>
                <p>Fixed multisinusoidal stimuli can be effectively used for nonlinear analysis if stimuli are created
                        with frequencies that elicit higher second order responses that do not overlap both the first
                        and second order responses. Analysis of these quadratic responses with QSA provides a compact
                        and unique description of neuronal properties independent of a particular computational model.</p>
                <p>In summary, neurons clearly have linear and nonlinear responses to input stimuli. The linear
                        responses are not just mirror images of the stimulus clearly being able to enhance certain
                        frequencies due to the linear resonant behavior. On the other hand, nonlinear responses are
                        considerably more complex as have been shown by the appearance of a multitude of new
                        interactive frequencies in the neuronal response that are not present in the input signal.
                        Furthermore, the fluctuations present in neurons due to inherent mechanisms and ongoing
                        synaptic activity can modify the nature of the nonlinear responses.</p>
                <a name="nonlinear_systems">
                        <h1>Nonlinear Systems</h1>
                </a>
                <p>For a linear system, the linear superposition principle implies that the response to a linear
                        superposition of sine waves is a linear superposition of sine waves with the same frequencies
                        but different amplitudes and phases. The linear superposition principle does not hold anymore
                        for nonlinear systems, which can have frequencies not present in the stimulation.</p>
                <p>More precisely, if a multisinusoidal stimulation has frequencies \(\omega_i\) and \(\omega_j\) then
                        the linear response will have frequencies \(\omega_i\) and \(\omega_j\) whereas the quadratic
                        response will have additional frequency interactions \(\left|\omega_i \pm \omega_j\right|\).</p>
                <p>We distinguish several classes of frequencies in the response to a multisinusoidal stimulation with
                        fundamentals \(\{\omega_k\}\):</p>
                <ul>
                        <li><b>Linear</b> : \(\omega_k\)</li>
                        <li><b>Diagonal</b> (or <b>harmonics</b>) : \(2 \omega_k\)</li>
                        <li><b>Plus</b> : \(\omega_i + \omega_j\) for \(i \neq j\)</li>
                        <li><b>Minus</b>: \(\left|\omega_i - \omega_j\right|\) for \(i \neq j\)</li>
                        <li><b>Quadratic</b> : diagonal, plus, minus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In practice, multisinusoidal stimulations must have sufficiently small amplitudes to elicit linear
                        and quadratic responses while these amplitudes must also be large enough to overcome the
                        background noise.</p>
                <p>Arbitrary multisinusoidal stimulations can generate frequency overlaps that make the responses
                        ambiguous in the frequency domain. Indeed, two input frequencies can sometimes generate the
                        same output frequency. For example, the input frequency set</p>
                \[\{1, 2, 3, 4\} \textrm{in hertz}\]
                <p>generates at least that ambiguity between two minus combinations</p>
                \[3 - 1 = 4 - 2\]
                <p>Hence, measuring the response at 2 hertz is not sufficient to distinguish the precise contribution
                        of each input pairs \(3 - 1\) and \(4 - 2\) in this response.</p>
                <p>In order to be able to make precise deterministic measurements, the QSA protocol requires to use
                        fundamental frequencies without overlap up to the second order. The <a href="../rtxi/rtxi.html"
                                target="_blank">RTXI module <b>qsa_stimulation</b></a> implements an algorithm to
                        generate such a set of nonoverlapping frequencies.</p>

                </a>
                <p>We illustrate QSA analysis for a current clamp experiment</p>
                \[V(t) = F\left[I(t)\right]\]
                <p>where \(I(t)\) is a multisinusoidal current stimulation with nonoverlapping frequencies
                        \(\{\omega_k\}\) and \(V(t)\) is the measured membrane potential. Clearly, other experimental
                        protocols can be used (e.g. voltage clamp). The aim is to determine the linear and quadratic
                        behavior of the neuronal function \(F\) in the frequency domain.</p>
                <p>The Fourier theory decomposes signals as linear combinations of complex exponentials including both
                        positive and negative frequencies. The minimal example is given by the cosine function:</p>
                \[\cos(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2} e^{i \omega t} + \frac{1}{2} e^{- i \omega t}\]
                <p>By convention, the fundamental frequencies \(\{\omega_k\}\) are extended to their negative mirror:</p>
                \[\omega_{-k} = - \omega_k\]
                <p>In linear analysis, the Fourier transform applied to \(I(t)\) and \(V(t)\) allows to compute the
                        linear transfer function, or impedance:</p>
                \[Z[\omega_k] = \frac{V[\omega_k]}{I[\omega_k]}\]
                <p>In quadratic analysis, the QSA theory allows to compute the quadratic transfer function</p>
                \[B[\omega_i,\omega_j] = \gamma_{i,j} \frac{V[\omega_i + \omega_j]}{I[\omega_i] I[\omega_j]}\]
                <p>where</p>
                \[\gamma_{i,i} = 1 \textrm{ and } \gamma_{i,j} = \frac{1}{2} \textrm{ for } i \neq j\]
                <p>Since \(\omega_k\) can be either positive or negative, the combinations \(\omega_i + \omega_j\)
                        include all sums and differences between \(\left|\omega_i\right|\) and
                        \(\left|\omega_j\right|\). By convention, we set \(B[\omega_k,\omega_{-k}] = 0\) in order to
                        study wave signals without DC.</p>
                <p>The cornerstone of QSA theory is that the QSA matrix</p>
                \[Q_{i,j} = B[- \omega_i,\omega_j]\]
                <p>is a Hermitian matrix. Thus, although this matrix has complex coefficients, its eigenvalues are real
                        numbers, which can be physically interpreted as amplitudes in \(mV / nA^2\).</p>
                <p>This formulation provides an algebraic description of the quadratic part of the membrane potential
                        as</p>
                \[V_2(t) = I_t^* Q I_t\]
                <p>where \(Q\) is the QSA matrix and \(I_t\) is a time dependent vector encoding the multisinusoidal
                        stimulation.</p>
                <p>The quadratic response can then be expressed as a sum of squares</p>
                \[V_2(t) = \sum_k \lambda_k \left|w_k\right|^2\]
                <p>where \(\lambda_k\) are eigenvalues of \(Q\) and \(w_k\) are stimulation components.</p>
                <p>Hence, the quadratic transfer function can be interpreted as a set of quadratic filters with
                        amplitudes given by the eigenvalues \(\lambda_k\).</p>
