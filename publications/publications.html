                        <div class="publication_abstract">The neurons in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex are
                                part of
                                the grid cell network involved in the representation of space. Many of these neurons
                                are likely
                                to be stellate cells with specific oscillatory and firing properties important for
                                their
                                function. A fundamental understanding of the nonlinear basis of these oscillatory
                                properties is
                                critical for the development of theories of grid cell firing. In order to evaluate the
                                behavior
                                of stellate neurons, measurements of their quadratic responses were used to estimate a
                                second
                                order Volterra kernel. This paper uses an operator theory, termed quadratic sinusoidal

                                (QSA), which quantitatively determines that the quadratic response accounts for a major
                                part of
                                the nonlinearity observed at membrane potential levels characteristic of normal

                                events. Practically, neurons were probed with multi-sinusoidal stimulations to
                                determine a
                                Hermitian operator that captures the quadratic function in the frequency domain. We
                                have shown
                                that the frequency content of the stimulation plays an important role in the
                                characteristics of
                                the nonlinear response, which can distort the linear response as well. Stimulations
                                with
                                enhanced low frequency amplitudes evoked a different nonlinear response than broadband
                                profiles. The nonlinear analysis was also applied to spike frequencies and it was shown
                                that
                                the nonlinear response of subthreshold membrane potential at resonance frequencies near

                                integrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye position. A
                                novel
                                system of frequency probing, namely quadratic sinusoidal analysis (QSA), was used to
                                decode the
                                intrinsic nonlinear behavior of these neurons under voltage clamp conditions. Voltage

                                currents were measured at harmonic and interactive frequencies using specific
                                nonoverlapping
                                stimulation frequencies. Eigenanalysis of the QSA matrix reduces it to a remarkably
                                compact
                                processing unit, composed of just one or two dominant components (eigenvalues). The QSA
                                matrix
                                of rat PHN neurons provides signatures of the voltage dependent conductances for their
                                particular dendritic and somatic distributions. An important part of the nonlinear
                                response is
                                due to the persistent sodium conductance (gNaP), which is likely to be essential for
                                sustained
                                effects needed for a neural integrator. It was found that responses in the range of 10
                                mV peak
                                to peak could be well described by quadratic nonlinearities suggesting that effects of
                                higher
                                degree nonlinearities would add only marginal improvement. Therefore, the quadratic
                                response is
                                likely to sufficiently capture most of the nonlinear behavior of neuronal systems
                                except for
                                extremely large synaptic inputs. Thus, neurons have two distinct linear and quadratic
                                functions, which shows that piecewise linear + quadratic analysis is much more complete
                                than
                                just piecewise linear analysis; in addition quadratic analysis can be done at a single
                                holding
                                potential. Furthermore, the nonlinear neuronal responses contain more frequencies over
                                a wider
                                frequency band than the input signal. As a consequence, they convert limited amplitude
                                and
                                bandwidth input signals to wider bandwidth and more complex output responses. Finally,
                                simulations at subthreshold membrane potentials with realistic PHN neuron models
                                suggest that
                                the quadratic functions are fundamentally dominated by active dendritic structures and

                                potentials that integrate synaptic inputs during action potential initiation. Previous
                                electrophysiological studies have made use of a piecewise linear characterization of
                                voltage
                                clamped neurons, which consists of a sequence of linear admittances computed at
                                different
                                voltage levels. In this paper, a fundamentally new theory is developed in two stages.
                                First,
                                analytical equations are derived for a multi-sinusoidal voltage clamp of a
                                Hodgkin-Huxley type
                                model to reveal the quadratic response at the ionic channel level. Second, the
                                resulting
                                behavior is generalized to a novel Hermitian neural operator, which uses an algebraic
                                formulation capturing the entire quadratic behavior of a voltage clamped neuron. In
                                addition,
                                this operator can also be used for a nonlinear identification analysis directly
                                applicable to
                                experimental measurements. In this case, a Hermitian matrix of interactions is built
                                with
                                paired frequency probing measurements performed at specific harmonic and interactive
                                output
                                frequencies. More importantly, eigenanalysis of the neural operator provides a concise
                                signature of the voltage dependent conductances determined by their particular
                                distribution on
                                the dendritic and somatic membrane regions of neurons. Finally, the theory is
                                concretely
                                illustrated by an analysis of an experimentally measured vestibular neuron, providing a
                                remarkably compact description of the quadratic responses involved in the nonlinear

                                Using a
                                unique combination of voltage-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and frequency-domain techniques, we

                                of neurons of the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), which is known to be involved in
                                oculomotor integration. The PHN contains two main neuronal populations: type B neurons
                                with a
                                double afterhyperpolarization and type D neurons, which not only are oscillatory but
                                also have
                                a greater electrotonic length than that of type B neurons. The persistent sodium
                                conductance is
                                present in all PHN neurons, although its effect on the dynamic electrotonic structure
                                is shown
                                to significantly differ in the two major cell types present in the nucleus. The
                                electrotonic
                                differences are such that the persistent sodium conductance can be almost perfectly

                                the passive cable properties and the voltage dependence of ion channel kinetics were
                                estimated,
                                including the electronic structure of the cell, the steady-state gating
                                characteristics, and
                                the time constants for particular voltage- and time-dependent ionic conductances. An
                                alternate
                                kinetic formulation was developed that consisted of steady-state values for the gating
                                parameters and their time constants at half-activation values as well as slopes of
                                these
                                parameters at half-activation. This procedure allowed independent restrictions on the
                                magnitude
                                and slope of both the steady-state gating variable and its associated time constant.
                                Quantitative estimates of the voltage-dependent membrane ion conductances and their
                                kinetic
                                parameters were used to solve the nonlinear equations describing dynamic responses. The
                                model
                                accurately predicts current clamp responses and is consistent with experimentally

                                TTX-resistant NMDA-induced patterned activity. In summary, an analysis method is
                                developed that
